# Video Visualization and Visual Analytics: A Task-Based and Application-Driven Investigation

**Abstract**â€” The exponential expansion of video data is a direct outcome of rapid advancements in digital technology. Various domains such as security, sports, education, and entertainment confront the generation and storage of a substantial volume of video data on a daily basis. These video data possess intricate characteristics, including large-scale, redundancy, contextual dependencies, and multimodality, which hinder the process of manual video analysis. Consequently, this has sparked extensive and profound research in the field of visualization, aiming to overcome these complexities. In this investigation, we retrospectively examine state-of-the-art techniques in video visualization and visual analysis. Initially, we summarize the design space of video visualization and visual analysis methods.
Subsequently, we organize and classify these methods based on visualization analysis tasks and application domains, providing detailed
descriptions of the techniques within each category. Drawing upon a comprehensive review of existing research, we finally present a
critical evaluation and propose potential avenues for future research. Additionally, we have developed an web-based survey browser for
convenient exploration and examination of our created classification framework, as well as the associated scholarly articles.
